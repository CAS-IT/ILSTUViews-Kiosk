# The Civil Debate Wall

The Civil Debate Wall — popularly known as ‘The Wall’ — is a unique, innovative
social media tool created by Local Projects (http://localprojects.net) for The
Bob Graham Center for Public Service (http://bobgrahamcenter.ufl.edu/) and
funded by a grant from the Knight Foundation. The Wall creates constructive
dialogue by providing a physical social media tool that connects large touch
screens, a texting system, and a website. These three synchronized components
create a single, seamless interactive experience for disenfranchised, younger
voters to actively engage in local, national and international issues.

# The Civil Debate Wall Kiosk

The Civil Debate Wall Kiosk is a five-screen installation at the Bob Graham
Center at the University of Gainesville Florida. It provides two basic modes.
One is active mode, in which a touch interface guides users through the process
of contributing their opinion to the system via SMS. The second is a passive
mode, or the "wall saver", in which data visualizations summarizing popular
opinion are presented across all five screens simultaneously. The screens share
a content pool and back-end API with a web-based version of the wall. 

Installation and other documentation is provided in the docs/ folder.
