# ILSTU Views

ILSTU Views â€” is a unique, innovative social media tool originally created 
by Local Projects (http://localprojects.net) for The Bob Graham Center for 
Public Service (http://bobgrahamcenter.ufl.edu/) and funded by a grant from
the Knight Foundation, and has been modified and implementated at Illinois
State University by CAS-IT TAP (http://lilt.ilstu.edu/) and the ISU chapter
of the American Democracy Project (http://americandemocracy.illinoisstate.edu/). 
ILSTU Views creates constructive dialogue by providing a physical social media
tool that connects large touch screens, a texting system, and a website. 
These three synchronized components create a single, seamless interactive
experience for disenfranchised, younger voters to actively engage in local, 
national and international issues.
